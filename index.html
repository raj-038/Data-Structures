      <p align=center>Data structure is a process through which data is stored and arranged in the disk space of the computer or memory storage, 
        in a way that the data can be easily used and manipulated in the future. It is an effective way of performing various operations 
        related to data management. With a sufficient understanding of data structure data can be organized and stored in a proper manner.</p>

      <h3 align=center> <br><br><u>Concept of space and time complexity</u></h3>
      <p align=center>Space complexity is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs. That means how much memory, in the worst case, is needed at any point in the algorithm.
        The algo which has lowest space complexity is considered the most efficient<br>
      Time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes the same amount of time).
        The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity.
