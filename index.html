      <h1><u>Data Structures and Algorithm, Importance and application</u></h1>
        <p>Data structure is a process through which data is stored and arranged in the disk space of the computer or memory storage,
        in a way that the data can be easily used and manipulated in the future. It is an effective way of performing various operations
        related to data management. With a sufficient understanding of data structure data can be organized and stored in a proper manner.</p>

    <div class="container-2">
      <h2 align=center> <br><br><u>Concept of Space and Time Complexity</u></h2>
      <p align=center>Space complexity is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs. That means how much memory, in the worst case, is needed at any point in the algorithm.
        The algorithm which has lowest space complexity is considered the most efficient.<br>
      Time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes the same amount of time).
        The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity.

      <h2>Classification of Data Structures:</h2>
      <h3 align=center> <br><br> <a href="linearDataStructures.html">Linear Data Structures</a></h3>
      <p>If the elements of a data structure are stored in a linear or sequential order, then it is a linear data
      structure. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Linear data structures can be
      represented in memory in two different ways. One way is to have to a linear relationship between
      elements by means of sequential memory locations. The other way is to have a linear relationship
      between elements by means of links.</p>
      <h3 align=center> <br><br><u> <a href="nonLinearDataStructures.html"> Non-Linear DS</u></a></h3>
      <p>However, if the elements of a data structure are not stored in a sequential order, then it is a
      non-linear data structure. The relationship of adjacency is not maintained between elements of a non-linear data structures. Examples includes trees and graphs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-4">
      <h2 align=center> <br><br><u>Sorting and searching</u></h2>
      <p>Searching and sorting are two of the most common operations in computer science. Searching refers to finding the position of a value in a collection of values. Sorting refers to arranging data in a certain order.</p>
